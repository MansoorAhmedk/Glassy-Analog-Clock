## 🧠 How It Works

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Basic structure with elements for clock hands and center.
- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Applies modern glassmorphism UI, positioning, shadows, and animation effects.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**:
  - Dynamically places numbers (1–12) around the clock using trigonometry.
  - Rotates the second, minute, and hour hands in real-time using `setInterval()` and `Date`.
